# Linux From Scratch Creator Live-CD (LFS-Creator)
Linux From Scratch Creator Live-CD (LFS-Creator) is a side project of mine where I customized an Ubuntu build, created a live-cd out of it, then published it on the internet. However this customized build comes with all necessary packages to build LFS with some extra utilities to see if the package dependencies are met.
