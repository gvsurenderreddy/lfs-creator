  "body": "### Welcome to Linux From Scratch Creator Live-CD (LFS-Creator)\r\nLinux From Scratch Creator Live-CD (LFS-Creator) is a side project of mine where I customized an Ubuntu build, created a live-cd out of it, then published it on the internet. However this customized build comes with all necessary packages to build LFS with some extra utilities to see if the package dependencies are met. This customized version of Ubuntu comes with the XFCE Desktop Environment (OpenBox and LightDM), essential packages such as an Internet Browser and Word Processor, along with the Numix theme for every component to really bring out its true potential. I created LFS-Creator because the project LFS stopped development on theirs, making it very difficult to find a perfect linux distro with the essential packages in the form of a Live-CD. When it says Live-CD, that's what this build is made for, so you can build Linux From Scratch without having to partition an extra space for it next to your main distro, you can do everything on the Live System. However it isn't recommended to install this customized remix because of its incompleteness, but it should be fine as a Live-CD. Note that I DID NOT create the Linux From Scratch project, just a nice swiss army knife to help you out building it.\r\n\r\n### What's Included:\r\n* All Packages required by Linux From Scratch\r\n* Shell Scripts to test out compatibility of current Linux From Scratch build\r\n* All Essential Applications (VLC, Abiword, Firefox, FileZilla, and more!)\r\n* wget-list for Easy Download of LFS Packages\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@AwlsomeAlex (Main Developer of LFS-Creator [The Live-CD, not the project]) \r\nGerard Beekmans (Creator of Linux From Scratch Project)\r\nBruce Dubbs (Linux From Scratch Manager)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with LFS-Creator?
